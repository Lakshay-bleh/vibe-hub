# 🛠️ Dev Toolkit

A clean, beginner-first **developer toolbox** built for the **Vibe Coding Challenge (Stage-2)**.  
It provides everyday developer utilities in a single responsive web app.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **JSON Formatter** → Pretty-print & validate JSON with error feedback
- **UUID Generator** → Generate + copy unique IDs with history
- **Color Paletter** → Create & pick palettes
- **Regex Tester** → Test expressions against sample text
- **Base64 Studio** → Encode/Decode text safely
- **Markdown Previewer** → Live Markdown rendering with styling

---

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS → functional & responsive UI  
- **Backend / State Handling:** Light state-based logic (custom hooks, localStorage) with **Builder.io** assistance (used for UI scaffolding & partial backend prototyping, but **not completely — custom logic was written manually**)  
- **Utilities:** Vanilla JavaScript (JSON parsing, UUIDs, Regex, Base64 conversions)  
- **Assets:** Logo from Dribbble (credited)
