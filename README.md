## ✅ Manual Contributions (by me)

- Built all core utilities from scratch (JSON, UUID, Regex, Base64, Markdown)
- Integrated all components into a functional React app
- Refactored and debugged code for stability and responsiveness
- Customized layouts, animations, and responsive behavior
- Set up local storage, history features, and logic hooks
- Reviewed and finalized this README and project documentation
- Managed version control and deployed final build via Netlify

## ⚙️ Assisted Contributions

- Used AI tools (ChatGPT) for drafting initial folder structures, component layouts, and providing quick development suggestions.
- Leveraged AI for optimizing TailwindCSS class combinations and improving UI responsiveness.
- Utilized Builder.io for rapid prototyping and UI wireframing to speed up the design process.
- Took AI assistance for debugging small issues such as JSON validation, RegEx testing, and minor code refinements.
- Generated an early draft of the README markdown, which was later reviewed, restructured, and refined by the team.
- Incorporated AI-driven suggestions for user experience enhancements, such as keyboard shortcuts and toast notifications.

🔐 **Note:** All AI-assisted contributions were reviewed, customized, and refined by the team before integration. No feature was directly copy-pasted or used without modification.
